# K-nearest-Neighbour-From-Scratch-Using-Numpy
 The kNN classifier consists of two stages:  - During training, the classifier takes the training data and simply remembers it - During testing, kNN classifies every test image by comparing to all training images and transfering the labels of the k most similar training examples  

 Used KNN classifier class to create an classifier model object that fits to the data (X, Y) generated  by prepare_dataset(). Using the above dataset (X,Y) i have fit the K-Nearest Neighbour Classifier and do the following 3 experiments

1. Pick 5 random sample points in range [-1, 1] X [-1, 1] and print model's prediction on the same.
2. Ablate for the above for k=2,5,10 \
3. Plot the sample points superimposed on the data (annotate them with a different colour) and display the same
